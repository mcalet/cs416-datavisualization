                    <p >Over the years, <span style="color: #DA291C; font-weight: bold;">Lego</span> has
                        grown a lot, both in the number of sets and their variety. In the first 10 years, starting from
                        1945, Lego released an average of 100 sets. By 2020, this number had grown to over 200 sets.
                        Since 1990, the steady increase in set releases shows how Lego continues to evolve and captivate
                        new and old generations.

                            style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">each decade to learn more about the evolution of
                            Lego.

                        number of set releases. A curious fact: more than half of the 300+ themes currently available
                        were introduced in the last 20 years.</p>

                        <h2>Lego's Largest and Most Complex Sets</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p id="graph3-desc">This graph shows how Lego has not only increased the number of themes released
                        over time but also made sets bigger and more challenging. <span style="color: #DA291C; font-weight: bold;">The World Map set, with over 11,000
                        pieces</span>, is the largest set currently available. The Eiffel Tower set, with more than 10,000
                        pieces, is both one of the largest and the tallest Lego sets, measuring 58.5 inches. Both of
                        these sets were released in the last five years. This demonstrates that as Lego's popularity has
                        grown, so has the complexity of its sets.</p>
